### Assignment 11 (02/10)
**Class and Objects - Create Calculator class**
1. Practice creating classes , multiple objects, constructors (default and parameterized)
2. Create a Calculator class which performs addition, multiplication and division. From the CalculatorDemo.java file, create objects and perform operations.
	1. The multiply method should take 2 int parameters and return an int
	2. The multiply method should take 3 int parameters and return an int
	3. The divide method should take 2  double  parameters and return an double
	4. The subtract method should take 2 int parameters and return an int


### Assignment 10 (02/09)
**Class and Objects**
1. Practice creating classes , multiple objects, methods (with no return and with return, with params, without params)
2. Assignment on Classes and objects
	1. Create a Student class with age, birthYear and noOfFriends.
	2. Create atleast 5 student objects.
	3. Print sum of all noOfFriends.
	4. In the class, create a method which prints the age group of the student depending on age. Eg: For age, 1-12 => print kid, 13 -> 19 => print teen , 20 - 45 => print adult, above 45 => print senior
	5. In the class, create a method which returns the sum of the digits of the birthYear
	


### Assignment 9 (02/08)
**Classes and Objects**
1. Go through the theory doc and understand the basic concepts of OOPs
2. Go through the basics of class/objects.
3. Create a class and two objects of that class.

### Assignment 8 (02/07)
**Programs**
1. Write a program to find if a number is a spy number
	* A number is defined as a spy number if the sum of its individual digits = product of its individual digits.
	* Eg: 123 is a spy number because sum and product of individual digits is same => 1+2+3 = 6 , 1*2*3 = 6
	* Eg: 324 is not a spy number because sum and product of individual digits is not same => 3+2+4 = 9 , 3*2*4 = 24
2. Write a program to find if a number is a pallindrome number
	* A number is defined as a pallindrome number if the number = reverse of the number
	* Eg: 121 is a pallindrome number because number and reverse of a number both are same => 121 = 121 (in reverse)
	* Eg: 123 is not a pallindrome number because number and reverse of a number both are not same => 123 != 321 (in reverse)
	


### Assignment 8 (02/06)
**Programs**
1. Write a program to add two matrices and store the result in a new matrix.
2. Try out various versions of the prime number program.
	* Using a variable (count)
	* Using a variable (count) and break
	* using a count and a flag + break
	* using only flag and break
3. Coding Standard
	* Class Naming - use camel case notations
	* Create separate files for different programs
	



### Assignment 7 (02/05)
**Arrays In Java, Try few programs**
1. Go through the arrays lecture, notes and programs.
2. Write a program to check if two arrays are equal or not. Eg 1: array1  = {2,3,4,5} , array2 = {2,3,4,5} , output should be true. Eg 2: array1  = {2,3,4,6} , array2 = {2,3,4,5} , output should be false.
3. Write a program to find the sum of numbers at even and odd indices in array and then print out the which sum is the greatest.
	* Eg: array = {4,5,2,8,3,6}
	* Sum at even indices = 4+2+3 = 9 (4 is at index 0, 2 is at index 2, 3 is at index 4)
	* Sum at odd  indices = 5+8+6 = 19 (5 is at index 1, 8 is at index 3, 6 is at index 5)
	* O/p should be: Sum at odd indices is greatest.
4. Find maximum and minimum in an array	.Eg: array = {4,5,2,8,3,6} , output: Max: 8 , Min:2

### Assignment 6 (02/05)
